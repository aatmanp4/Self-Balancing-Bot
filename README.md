## Introduction

The Self-Balancing Bot is a robotic project designed to maintain its balance autonomously using sensor feedback and control algorithms. It is an excellent project for learning about control systems, robotics, and embedded programming.

## Features

- Self-balancing capability using a PID control algorithm
- Real-time sensor data acquisition
- Adjustable control parameters for tuning performance
- Simple and modular design for easy modifications and improvements

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started with the Self-Balancing Bot, you'll need the following:

- A microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32)
- IMU sensor (e.g., MPU6050)
- Motors and motor drivers
- Basic electronic components (resistors, capacitors, etc.)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Usage

1. Assemble the hardware as described in the [Hardware](#hardware) section.
2. Connect the microcontroller to your computer.
3. Open the project in the Arduino IDE.
4. Adjust the PID control parameters in the code if necessary.
5. Upload the code to the microcontroller.
6. Power the robot and observe its self-balancing behavior.

## Hardware

The hardware setup for the Self-Balancing Bot includes:

- **Microcontroller**: The brain of the robot, responsible for processing sensor data and controlling the motors.
- **IMU Sensor**: Measures the orientation and acceleration of the robot.
- **Motors and Motor Drivers**: Provide movement and stability.
- **Chassis**: The structure that holds all components together.
